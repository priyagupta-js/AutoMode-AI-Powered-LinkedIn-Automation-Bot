    Day 1 of 100 | #100DaysOfDSA  
    Topic: Arrays  
    Problems Solved:  
    ✅ Problem 1: Left Rotate an Array by One Place  
    ✅ Problem 2: Left Rotate an Array by D Places  

    ✨ Starting my #100DaysOfDSA challenge to build strong problem-solving skills and prepare better for coding     interviews.

    Today's focus was on mastering basic array manipulation techniques — a strong foundation goes a long way!

    ~ Learned about rotation logic using temporary variables and modular indexing.  
    ~ Practiced dry runs and optimized code to improve time complexity.
